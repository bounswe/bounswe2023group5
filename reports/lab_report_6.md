# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Video Game Community Platform - Group 5

**Date:** 14.11.2023

## Progress Summary

This week, all teams primarily focused on enhancing communication components of the platform, such as the review, forum, and comments features. We have largely completed the forum, reviews, and comments sections. As a team, we simplemented the basic functionality for forum, review, and comment posting, and their respective pages are now finalized with established and operational backend connections. Edit and delete functionalities have been incorporated for reviews, posts, and comments. Additionally, a voting feature has been added to both reviews and forums. Furthermore, this week we've started incorparating admin and moderation functionalities into the relevant components, implemented game creation feature. Some visual enhancements for these components and additional features like sorting, filtering, and comment replies will be planned for the next week. The backend team has successfully established an automated CI/CD process. The frontend team will work on the implementation of automated CI/CD next week. In addition to these, all teams will work on mainly on groups feature of the platform next week.

## Planned Vs. Actual

- We couldn't find the time and implement automated CI/CD of the frontend
- Some admin additions on forums and reviews couldn't be done
- Mobile's admin control panel page couldn't be completed
- It has come to our attention that the requirements include additional functionalities beyond what we initially defined in the issues like sorting/filtering of posts/reviews and comment replying. In order to address this requirements new issues will be planned for next week.

## Your plans for the next week

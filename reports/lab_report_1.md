## Risks
- Failing to create a balanced distribution between teams may result in the members of certain teams to be responsible for a higher amount of tasks.
- The formation of mobile team will necessiate the members of this team to learn new technologies and tools.
- Not being able to decide on meeting times prior to the next lab session.
- Not being able to find relevant domain specific elements due to misunderstanding on the desires of the stakeholders.
- Deciding on technologies which are not suitable / incompatible according to our use cases on our application.

## Planned vs. Actual
- We'd decided to agree on teams and necessary changes on our requirements and class diagrams. 
- We also decided the technologies create a "Hello world" app for each project.
- We created docker file for frontend and backend.
- The most significant change from last week is the choice of programming language used by the mobile team. 
- Last week, the mobile team planned to use Kotlin, but this week they decided to switch to Unity, and they have adjusted their tasks accordingly.
- We decided just to initialize the backend part of the project however, we've also started implementing few endpoints such as user register endpoint.
- Last week, we didn't decide anything about setting up our database yet, we've set up our MongoDb Server database for our project.

## Risks
- Not being able to coming up with a solid implementation of endpoints due to lack of knowledge and experience on decided backend technologies.
 
## Conventions

**Frontend Conventions**
  - All components will have specific and meaningful names, and they will not be implemented as anonymous functions.
  - When defining prop parameters in components, prop types will be given next to the prop parameters using :. We will avoid using React.FC.
  - We will always destructure props in our components to make it clear which props are being used.
  - If a component has more than four props, we will declare the prop types in their own interface named "ComponentNameProps" to enhance code organization and readability.
  -  We will utilize the available antd components to maintain consistency and take advantage of their features.
  - We will ensure consistent code formatting by using a .prettierrc configuration and enabling automatic formatting on save in our code editor.
  - Each file will export only one component, and that component will be the default export of the file. 
  - We will avoid making Axios calls directly within components. Instead, we will use services defined in external files. Our preferred approach for handling data fetching is to use a library like React Query for a more organized and efficient data management solution.
 
**Backend Conventions**
  - Code Structure:

     Backend part of the project will follow this folder structure:
      - config
      - controller
      - exception
      - model
      - repository
      - service
      - util
where details will reside in documentation page (README) of backend.

  - Naming Conventions:
    - Java class names will be in `PascalCase` and methods will be in `camelCase`.
    - REST endpoints will follow RESTful naming conventions. For example: `GET /users` for retrieving all users, and `POST /users` for creating a new user.

  - Database:
    - We will use Spring Data MongoDB for database operations and take advantage of its repository abstractions.


  - Documentation:
    - We will utilize OpenAPI's Swagger integration for API documentation and testing. This provides a user-friendly interface to understand and interact with the API endpoints.

  - Testing:
    - Unit tests will be written using JUnit and Mockito.
    - Test coverage will be regularly reviewed, and efforts will be made to maintain a high coverage percentage.
convention.md

**Mobile Conventions**
  - Unity and Rider will be used for mobile development.
  - All components will have specific and meaningful names, and they will not be implemented as anonymous functions.
  - We will implement Object Oriented Programming paradigm.
  - Members will avoid pushing changes in main scene on to main branch on their own. Instead prefabs of changes will be created and shared with the person responsible for pushing to main branch.
  - Branch will be named according to functionality of the branch.

  - In this milestone we tried to write backend unit test while implementing them. This gave us the opportunity to detect bugs beforehand. By writing these tests we could also ensure that future codes would not impact the functionalities of some other sections.
  - Secondly, in this milestone, we paid more attention to reviews. For example we changed the styling of the login/register page in frontend and make some coloring adjustments based on the given feedbacks. This created a better UI and gave us a opportunity to see our mistakes. 
  - Also, by experiencing first two milestone we learned how to create a realistic and detailed scenario. So, in this milestone I think we created a better scenario. In this way we affect our customers more easily and make them more satisfied.
  - In the final milestone demo, we realized that the objective of the annotation feature is to provide all users with the opportunity to annotate content on the page. We had thought that there might be constraints to this opportunity, but the demo demonstrated that such limitations were unnecessary.
